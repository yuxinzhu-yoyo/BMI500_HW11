HW 2: Agent-Based Modeling of Pandemic Spread
Disclaimer: No generative AI (in any form) has been used to complete this homework itself. this piece of work is just as lame as it is.
            But the summary here is generated by ChatGPT.
Key Insights:
The simulation clearly demonstrates how social distancing measures can significantly reduce the peak number of infections and delay the peak time of an epidemic.
Varying the movement probability (representing different levels of social distancing) shows that stricter measures (lower movement probability) result in lower infection peaks and more prolonged infection durations.
Comparative Model Performance:
Models with higher movement probabilities show quicker spread and higher peaks of infection, stressing the healthcare system.
Lower movement probabilities effectively flatten the curve, reducing both the rate and extent of the infection spread.
Relevance to Model-Based Machine Learning:
This simulation aligns with model-based machine learning by using a predictive model to simulate different scenarios and outcomes based on parameter variations. It serves as a practical example of how agent-based modeling can be utilized for making informed public health decisions.
Suggestions for Future Modeling Improvements:
Integrate more realistic social interactions and mobility patterns to reflect real-world scenarios better.
Explore the impact of other interventions, like vaccination and targeted lockdowns, alongside social distancing.
